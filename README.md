# fticrawler
A crawler for the website [fourtoutici.top](fourtoutici.top)

**WARNING** I'm not responsible of the files that can be found on this website.
Use this implementation at your own risk.

## Basics
This project is made of a library in charge of:
- sending a search request to the [fourtoutici.top](fourtoutici.top) server.
- getting a list of the available files corresponding to the request.
- download the files after having resolved the captcha-like process.

## Dependencies
This project uses the _requests_ library available [here](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
**This is a masterpiece.**
